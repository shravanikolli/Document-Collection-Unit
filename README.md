# Document Collection Unit

This project is a POC that i worked on my own to become more fluent in Angular JS. Just to give a complete picture, the application contains few application tabs as below<br>

1) Projects<br/>
2) Supplier Contracts <br/>
3) Deliverables (Documents from party) <br/>
4) Transmittals (Documents to Party) <br/>
5) Submit History (History of all Docs) <br/>

Each project will have set of contracts and these contracts will have different tabs like deliverables, transmittals and submit history.<br/>

In Supplier Exchange package -> partials : logic for above mentioned components are defined.
In Supplier Exchange package -> js : has layout and form validations for the defined UI components.
